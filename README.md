# Project Repository Readme

Welcome to our GitHub repository! Before you start making any changes or adding new features to the project, please follow the instructions below to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain a well-organized codebase.

## Reporting Changes and New Features

1. **Discussion in Group**: Before starting any major development or making significant changes, create a discussion within the project group. This discussion should include a detailed description of the proposed changes or new features. This step is crucial to gather feedback and ensure everyone is on the same page.

2. **Issue Tracking**: After the group discussion, create an issue on GitHub describing the changes or features you plan to implement. This will serve as a reference point for discussion and act as a central place for tracking the progress of the proposed changes.

## Contributing Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you are not a direct collaborator, start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Branch Naming Convention**: When working on a new feature or bug fix, always create a new branch with a descriptive name. Use the following format for branch names:
   ```
   feature/your-feature-name
   bugfix/issue-number
   ```

3. **Code Review**: Before pushing your changes to the repository, ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to the project's coding guidelines. A code review is encouraged to maintain code quality.

4. **Pull Request**: When your changes are ready for review, open a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch. Make sure to reference the issue related to your changes in the pull request description.

5. **Review and Merge**: Your pull request will be reviewed by one or more project maintainers. If there are any required changes or suggestions, address them accordingly. Once the changes are approved, your branch will be merged into the main repository.

## Coding Guidelines

1. Follow the programming language conventions and best practices used in the project.

2. Write clear and concise code with meaningful variable and function names.

3. Comment your code when necessary to improve readability and understanding.

4. Ensure your code is formatted properly and free of linting errors.
